  %Finding biclusters in gene expression matrices provides biologists and physicians invaluable information about the effects of disease at the genetic level.
  %Gene expression levels of organisms are measured by DNA microarrays:
  %Biclusters in gene expression matrices give information about which genes are up-regulated/down-regulated under certain conditions.
  %Applications include disease subtyping such as in leukemia and breast cancer, powdery mildew (plant); organisms.
  %We propose a methodology for evolutionary based biclustering algorithms using NSGA-II.
  %Key contributions in addition to novel algorithm framework include new synthetic data generation.
  %Improve recovery and relevance external validation measures.

      Finding biclusters in gene expression matrices provides biologists and physicians invaluable information about the effects of disease at the genetic level.
      Gene expression levels of organisms are measured by DNA microarrays:
      Biclusters in gene expression matrices give information about which genes are up-regulated/down-regulated under certain conditions.
      Applications include disease subtyping such as in leukemia, breast cancer, and powdery mildew (plant).
      We propose a methodology for evolutionary-based biclustering using the NSGA-II algorithm.
      In addition to the novel biclustering algorithm framework, we propose new methods for synthetic data generation.
      We also propose an improvement to existing recovery and relevance external validation measures.
