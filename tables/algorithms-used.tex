		\toprule
		Algorithm (Year) & Description & Implementation Source \\
		\midrule
        CC (2000)
        & Deterministic greedy algorithm that finds biclusters by minimizing the Mean Squared Residue (MSR) score of a discovered submatrix
        & Python \cite{Eren2013} \\ \\

        ISA (2003)
        & Non-deterministic method that discovers biclusters in an iterative manner, even in the presence of noise and overlapping biclusters.
        & R package \texttt{isa2} \cite{csardi2010modular} \\ \\
        
		OPSM (2003)
		& Deterministic method based on an optimal reordering approach of using a probabilistic model to describe the biclusters.
		& BicAT \cite{barkow2006bicat} \\ \\
		
		FABIA (2010)
		& A generative multiplicative model for discovering biclusters by assuming a non-Gaussian signal distributions with heavy tails.
		& Bioconductor \texttt{fabia} \cite{hochreiter2010fabia} \\ \\
		
		Evo-Bexpa (2013)
		& An evolutionary computing approach to the biclustering problem.
		  Fitness function is based on transposed virtual error, degree of overlap, and gene variance.
		& Python$^1$ \cite{pontes2013configurable} \\ \\
		
		PPM (2015)
		& A modified extended version of the Bayesian biclustering model.
		  The PPM method fully accounts for a general overlapping structure.
		  Parameters in the Penalized Plaid model are found all at once by a dedicated Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler.
		& Java \cite{chekouo2015thepenalized} \\ \\
		
		UniBic (2016)
		& Applies longest common subsequence algorithm to translate the input data matrix to a rank matrix such that the rows are discretized as rank vectors.
		& C$^2$ \cite{wang2016unibic} \\ \\
		
		BicPAMS (2017)
		& Aggregate of state-of-the-art pattern mining approaches in biclustering.
		& Java$^3$ \cite{henriques2017bicpams} \\
